## System Overview
Locify is a cross-platform application (iOS, Android, and backend) designed to allow users to save and manage locations, supporting both online and offline modes. The system uses a client-server architecture with Firebase for authentication and storage, a PostgreSQL database for structured data, and local storage for offline support. The backend is built with Java/Spring Boot, while both the iOS and Android apps use Swift and Kotlin, respectively, with Google Maps SDK for map functionalities.

Key features:
- **Online/Offline Support**: Users can save, edit, and delete locations and categories offline, with data syncing when online.
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication manages user sessions, with offline login support using cached credentials.
- **Data Synchronization**: Local data syncs with the server upon login or network availability, handling conflicts and batch processing.
- **Image Handling**: Images are stored in Firebase Storage by the client, with temporary local storage for offline use. The backend deletes images during user account deletion to clean up storage.

## Components
1. **Client Applications**:
   - **iOS App**: Built with Swift, using Google Maps SDK for maps and Firebase SDK for authentication/storage.
   - **Android App**: Built with Kotlin, using Google Maps SDK and Firebase SDK.
   - **Local Storage**: SwiftData (iOS) and Room (Android) for caching data and supporting offline operations.
2. **Backend Service**:
   - **Java/Spring Boot**: Handles API requests, business logic, database interactions, and image deletion in Firebase Storage during user deletion.
   - **PostgreSQL**: Stores structured data (users, locations, categories).
   - **Firebase Authentication**: Manages user authentication and token verification.
   - **Firebase Storage**: Stores images and category icons, managed by clients for uploads and by the backend for deletions.
3. **External Services**:
   - **Google Maps SDK**: Provides map rendering, search, and navigation for both iOS and Android.

## Data Flow

### 1. Authentication Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant LocalDB
    participant Auth
    participant API
    participant DB

    Note over Client: App starts or user logs in
    Client->>Auth: Sign in with Firebase
    Auth-->>Client: Return Firebase ID Token
    Note over Client,LocalDB: Store token for offline use
    Client->>LocalDB: Store auth token
    Note over Client: Check token validity
    Client->>Auth: Refresh token if expired
    Auth-->>Client: Return new token or error
    alt Token refresh fails
        Client->>Client: Prompt user to re-login
    end
    Note over Client: User logs out
    alt Online
        Client->>Auth: Call FirebaseAuth.signOut()
        Auth-->>Client: Confirm session cleared
        Client->>LocalDB: Remove token, set isLoggedOut: false
    else Offline
        Client->>LocalDB: Set isLoggedOut: true, retain token
        Note over Client: When network available
        Client->>Auth: Call FirebaseAuth.signOut()
        Auth-->>Client: Confirm session cleared
        Client->>LocalDB: Remove token, set isLoggedOut: false
    end
    Note over Client,API: Include token in API requests
    Client->>API: Include token in requests
    API->>Auth: Verify token
    Auth-->>API: Token valid
    API->>DB: Process request
    DB-->>API: Return data
    API-->>Client: Return response
    Note over Client,LocalDB: Cache data for offline use
    Client->>LocalDB: Cache response data
```

**Key Points**:
- Firebase ID Token is stored locally for offline use and refreshed automatically when online.
- Offline logout sets `isLoggedOut: true` and defers `FirebaseAuth.signOut()` until network is available.
- API requests include the Firebase token, verified by the backend using Firebase Authentication.

### 2. Data Synchronization Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant LocalDB
    participant API
    participant DB

    Note over Client: User logs in or network available
    Client->>LocalDB: Query unsynced records
    LocalDB-->>Client: Return records with sync_status
    Note over Client: Send batch requests
    Client->>API: Send pendingCreate, pendingUpdate, pendingDelete
    API->>DB: Validate and process changes
    DB-->>API: Update records, set sync_status: synced
    API-->>Client: Return updated records
    Note over Client,LocalDB: Update local storage
    Client->>LocalDB: Update records with server data
    alt Conflict detected
        API-->>Client: Return E008 error with server version
        Client->>LocalDB: Update with server version
        Client->>Client: Prompt user for manual resolution
    end
```

**Key Points**:
- Synchronization occurs after login, when network connectivity is restored, or manually triggered by the user.
- The client sends batch requests (up to 50 records) with `sync_status: pendingCreate`, `pendingUpdate`, or `pendingDelete`.
- The server uses `updated_at` to resolve conflicts, rejecting older changes with an `E008` error.
- Synced records are updated in local storage with `sync_status: synced`.

### 3. Offline Support Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant LocalDB

    Note over Client: Offline mode
    Client->>LocalDB: Create, update, or delete record
    LocalDB-->>Client: Store with sync_status: pending*
    Note over Client: Image handling (if logged in)
    Client->>LocalDB: Store images/icons as file:// URLs
    Note over Client: Network restored
    Client->>LocalDB: Query unsynced records
    LocalDB-->>Client: Return pending records
    Client->>API: Send pending changes and upload images
    API-->>Client: Return updated records with Firebase Storage URLs
    Client->>LocalDB: Update records with server data
```

**Key Points**:
- Offline operations are stored in local storage (SwiftData for iOS, Room for Android) with appropriate `sync_status`.
- Images/icons, when logged in, are stored locally as `file://` URLs and uploaded to Firebase Storage when online.
- Changes are synced with the server when network connectivity is restored.

### 4. Image Handling Flow
```mermaid

    participant Storage

    Note over Client: Image upload (online, logged in)
    Client->>Storage: Upload image/icon
    Storage-->>Client: Return Firebase Storage URL
    Client->>API: Send record with image URLs
    API->>DB: Store record with URLs
    DB-->>API: Confirm save
    API-->>Client: Return updated record
    Client->>LocalDB: Update record with URLs
    Note over Client: Image upload (offline, logged in)
    Client->>LocalDB: Store image as file:// URL
    Note over Client: Network restored
    Client->>LocalDB: Query pending records
    LocalDB-->>Client: Return records with file:// URLs
    Client->>Storage: Upload images/icons
    Storage-->>Client: Return Firebase Storage URLs
    Client->>API: Send updated records
    API->>DB: Update records
    DB-->>API: Confirm update
    API-->>Client: Return updated records
    Client->>LocalDB: Update records with server data
    Note over API: Category deletion
    API->>DB: Query icon URL and location image URLs
    DB-->>API: Return icon/image URLs
    API->>Storage: Delete icon and location images
    Storage-->>API: Confirm deletion
    API->>DB: Delete category and locations
    DB-->>API: Confirm deletion
    API-->>Client: Return 204 No Content
    Note over API: User deletion
    API->>DB: Query image URLs for user
    DB-->>API: Return image URLs
    API->>Storage: Delete images
    Storage-->>API: Confirm deletion
    API->>DB: Delete user data
    DB-->>API: Confirm deletion
```

**Key Points**:
- Image selection is only available when the user is logged in; otherwise, a message is displayed: "Please log in to add or remove images."
- When logged in, images are uploaded to Firebase Storage by the client when online or stored locally (e.g., `file://`) when offline.
- Image URLs are updated in local storage and synced with the server.
- Offline images are marked as pending upload and processed when online.
- For individual image deletions (e.g., editing location/category) or location deletions, the client deletes images from Firebase Storage using the Firebase SDK. Offline, local image files (e.g., `file://`) are deleted immediately to free device storage.
- For category deletions, the backend queries the database for the categoryâ€™s icon URL and all image URLs of associated locations, then deletes them from Firebase Storage before removing database records.
- During user deletion, the backend queries the database for all image URLs associated with the user (including `avatar_url` for the user profile) and deletes them from Firebase Storage before removing database records.

**Additional Details**:
- See [Locify_API_Documentation.md](./Locify_API_Documentation.md) for image constraints (e.g., 5MB max size, 10 images per location) and user deletion endpoint.
- Image storage paths:
  - Location images: `/locations/{user_id}/{location_id}/{image_id}`
  - Category icons: `/categories/{user_id}/{category_id}/icon`
  - User profile images: `/users/{user_id}/profile`
- Firebase Storage security rules ensure user-specific access control.
- The backend uses batch processing for image deletions during category or user deletion to optimize performance.

```

**Key Points**:
- **Client Interaction**:
  - iOS and Android clients send HTTP requests to the **API Server** for CRUD operations on categories and locations.
  - Clients authenticate using **Firebase Authentication**, obtaining tokens for secure API requests.
  - Clients upload and delete images/icons directly to/from **Firebase Storage** using the Firebase Storage SDK for individual location updates, location deletions, or category icon updates (excluding category deletions), but only when logged in.
  - Offline data is cached in **Local Storage** (SwiftData for iOS, Room for Android), with local image/icon files (e.g., `file://`) deleted immediately upon marking `pendingDelete` or `pendingUpdate` to free device storage.
- **Backend Interaction**:
  - The **API Server** processes requests, queries the **PostgreSQL** database, and verifies tokens via **Firebase Authentication**.
  - For category deletions (including associated locations) or user account deletions, the **API Server** deletes images/icons from **Firebase Storage** using the Firebase Admin SDK in batches, ensuring data integrity with database transactions.
- **Data Flow**:
  - Data is synchronized between client and server when online, with offline changes marked as `pendingCreate`, `pendingUpdate`, or `pendingDelete` in **Local Storage**.
  - Images/icons are stored in **Firebase Storage** with paths organized by `user_id` (e.g., `/locations/{user_id}/{location_id}/{image_id}`, `/categories/{user_id}/{category_id}/icon`, `/users/{user_id}/profile`).
