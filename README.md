## Branch Naming Rules
To keep the repository organized, we follow a consistent naming convention:

### Format
```bash
<type>/<platform>/<description>
```

- **`<type>`**: feature, bugfix, hotfix, release.
- **`<platform>`**: ios, android, backend.
- **`<description>`**: Short, kebab-case description.

### Main Branches
- **`main`**: Stable production-ready code.
- **`develop`**: Main development branch for all platforms.

### Examples
  - `feature/ios/add-map`
  - `feature/android/save-location-ui`
  - `feature/backend/new-endpoint`
  - `bugfix/ios/fix-crash-on-search`
  - `hotfix/backend/fix-env-vars`
  - `release/v1.0.0`

---

## Commit Message Convention
Commits should be clear, concise, and follow a consistent format to improve readability and history tracking.

### Format
```bash
[<Platform>] <Verb> <Short Description>
```

- **`<Platform>`**: 
    - [iOS], [Android], [Backend] â€” optional for platform-specific changes.
    - Omit this tag if the change affects all platforms (e.g., update README or scripts).
- **`<Verb>`**: Start with a present-tense action verb (e.g., Add, Fix, Update).
- **`<Short Description>`**: Describe the change concisely.

### Examples
- [iOS] Add map view to home screen.
- [Android] Fix crash on navigation button click.
- [Backend] Implement save location endpoint.
- Update README with new rules.
